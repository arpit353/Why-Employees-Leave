# Introduction 
Employee attrition is very important. Companies spend lots of resources, money and valuable time to train their employees to get the best results and hence if the employee leaves the company due to some reason it is a great loss of human resource for the company. Therefore, understanding why employees leave is very important for businesses to maximize efficiency and reduce training cost which translates into greater profit.

# What is what?
This project includes :
- Gathering Data
- Preparing that Data
- Data visualization and cleaning
- Training
- Evaluation
- Prediction

In this project, I have used two classifiers :
- SVC
- Random Forest Classifier

SVC gives 95.6% of accuracy whereas RandomForest Classifier gives 98.8% of accuracy.

After this, I draw community detection algorithm, to analyse the community of those employees who are thinking of leaving the company. Further information can be found in **Community Detection.ipynb**
